I am a web designer and WordPress specialist with over 2 years of continuous experience in designing and implementing responsive, optimized, and practical websites.
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology with a specialization in Web Design from the Informatics Institute of Iran.

I specialize in page-builder tools such as Elementor and have completed numerous successful projects for various companies. I have solid experience working with WooCommerce and many other reputable plugins, including configuring them properly for websites. I'm also familiar with hooks, actions, and filters in WordPress and can use them to implement certain customizations and add new features.

I am capable of building custom corporate and e-commerce websites using reliable barebone themes such as Hello Elementor, Astra, and others. I know how to configure child themes and write custom CSS and JS code within them. Supporting and maintaining deployed websites, developing various landing pages, and optimizing websites for speed and security are also among my core skills.

I always handle graphic adjustments and image edits myself, and Iâ€™m proficient in using Photoshop to produce optimized, clean, and standard image outputs. Iâ€™m familiar with various image formats and clearly understand their capabilities and differences.
I also have a solid understanding of basic UI/UX principles for websites, along with a good eye for visual design and aesthetics, which helps me implement visually appealing websites that offer proper and effective user interaction.

And finally, Iâ€™d like to say that I love my job and am always striving for further progress and learningâ€¦
